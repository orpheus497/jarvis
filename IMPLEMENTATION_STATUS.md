# Asyncio Implementation Status

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Network Layer - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/jarvis/network.py`

**Changes Implemented:**
- Converted all P2P connections to use `asyncio.open_connection()` and `asyncio.start_server()`
- Replaced all `threading.Thread` with `asyncio.Task`
- Implemented async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Used `asyncio.StreamReader` and `asyncio.StreamWriter` for all network I/O
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific exception types (SecurityError, ConnectionError, etc.)
- Implemented connection health monitoring with detailed statistics:
  - Connection attempts, successful/failed counts
  - Bytes sent/received tracking
  - Messages sent/received counting
  - Connection duration monitoring
  - Last error tracking with timestamps
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Added extensive logging for diagnostics
- Proper timeout handling for all operations (connect, handshake, operations)
- Graceful connection cleanup and resource management

**Key Classes:**
1. `P2PConnection` - Async peer-to-peer connection handler
2. `P2PServer` - Async server for incoming P2P connections
3. `NetworkManager` - Async network manager coordinating all connections

**Technical Details:**
- All methods are now `async def` coroutines
- Uses `asyncio.Queue` for message queuing (replaces `queue.Queue`)
- Uses `asyncio.Lock` for thread-safety (replaces `threading.Lock`)
- Background tasks use `asyncio.create_task()` (replaces `threading.Thread`)
- Proper cancellation handling for all tasks
- Timeout handling with `asyncio.wait_for()`

## Required Next Steps

### Phase 2: Server IPC Layer
**File:** `src/jarvis/server.py`

**Required Changes:**
1. Convert IPC listener to use `asyncio.start_server()` or `asyncio.start_unix_server()`
2. Replace threading-based client handling with async coroutines
3. Convert all command handlers to async methods
4. Update event broadcasting to use async
5. Make `start()`, `stop()`, and `run()` methods async
6. Update callback invocations to handle async callbacks
7. Replace `threading.Lock` with `asyncio.Lock`

### Phase 3: Client IPC Layer
**File:** `src/jarvis/client.py`

**Required Changes:**
1. Convert connection to use `asyncio.open_connection()` or `asyncio.open_unix_connection()`
2. Replace threading-based receive loop with async coroutine
3. Convert all request/response methods to async
4. Update event callback system for async
5. Use `asyncio.Queue` for response handling
6. Replace `threading.Lock` with `asyncio.Lock`

### Phase 4: Client Adapter
**File:** `src/jarvis/client_adapter.py`

**Required Changes:**
1. Update to work with async client
2. Ensure compatibility with async NetworkManager
3. Handle async method calls appropriately

### Phase 5: Main Entry Point
**File:** `src/jarvis/main.py`

**Required Changes:**
1. Set up asyncio event loop
2. Handle async server startup
3. Coordinate async client connection

### Phase 6: UI Integration
**File:** `src/jarvis/ui.py`

**Required Changes:**
1. Verify Textual integration with async backend
2. Ensure UI methods properly await async operations
3. Handle async callbacks in UI event handlers

## Technical Blueprint Compliance

‚úÖ **Unified Asynchronous Architecture**: Network layer uses asyncio throughout
‚úÖ **Non-blocking Operations**: All I/O operations use async/await
‚úÖ **P2P Networking**: Uses asyncio.start_server() and asyncio.open_connection()
üîÑ **IPC Strategy**: Needs implementation for server/client (Unix Domain Sockets on POSIX, TCP on Windows)
üîÑ **Event Loop Integration**: Needs completion once all components are async

## Current State

The P2P networking layer (Phase 1) is complete and fully converted to asyncio. However, the application cannot run yet because:

1. The server still uses threading for IPC
2. The client still uses threading for IPC  
3. These components need to be converted to asyncio to work with the async network layer

The document mandates a unified async architecture, which means all components must be converted together for the application to function properly. The network layer conversion is complete and serves as the foundation, but server and client IPC layers must also be converted to create a functional application.

## Testing Strategy

Once all phases are complete:
1. Update existing tests to use pytest-asyncio
2. Test P2P connections between async instances
3. Test IPC communication between async client and server
4. Test UI responsiveness with async event loop
5. Perform integration testing across all components
6. Validate on all target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, Termux)

## Documentation Updates

‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md updated with asyncio conversion details
‚úÖ ASYNCIO_REFACTORING.md created with implementation plan
‚è≥ README.md may need updates once complete
‚è≥ Additional documentation for async API usage
