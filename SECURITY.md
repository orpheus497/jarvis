## Encryption Architecture

### Five-Layer Encryption

Every message in Jarvis passes through five independent layers of encryption:

**Layer 1: AES-256-GCM (First Encryption)**
- Algorithm: Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode
- Key Size: 256 bits
- Nonce: 96 bits (unique per message)
- Authentication: 128-bit authentication tag

**Layer 2: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Second Encryption)**
- Algorithm: ChaCha20 stream cipher with Poly1305 authenticator
- Key Size: 256 bits
- Nonce: 96 bits (unique per message)
- Authentication: 128-bit authentication tag

**Layer 3: AES-256-GCM (Third Encryption)**
- Same as Layer 1 with independent key and nonce

**Layer 4: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (Fourth Encryption)**
- Same as Layer 2 with independent key and nonce

**Layer 5: AES-256-GCM (Fifth Encryption)**
- Same as Layer 1 with independent key and nonce

**Why Five Layers?**
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple independent algorithms and keys
- **Algorithm Diversity:** Alternating AES and ChaCha20 prevents single-algorithm attacks
- **Future-Proof:** If one algorithm is compromised, four others still protect the data
- **Hardware + Software:** AES benefits from CPU acceleration (AES-NI), ChaCha20 is constant-time in software
- **Authentication:** Each layer verifies integrity, preventing tampering

### Key Exchange

**Algorithm:** X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
- **Curve:** Curve25519 (Montgomery curve)
- **Security Level:** 128 bits (equivalent to 3072-bit RSA)
- **Properties:**
  - Fast key agreement
  - Small key size (32 bytes)
  - Constant-time implementation (side-channel resistant)
  - No weak keys or special cases

**Key Derivation:** HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)
- **Hash Functions:** SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 (different for each layer)
- **Purpose:** Derive five independent session keys from shared secret
- **Salt:** Each key derivation uses previous key as salt
- **Info String:** Unique for each layer ("jarvis-session-key-X-layer-Y")

**Session Keys:**
- Five independent 256-bit keys
- Unique per connection
- Never reused across sessions
- Derived using cryptographically strong KDF

### Identity Protection

**Master Password:**
- Never stored on disk (not even hashed)
- Only exists in memory during operation
- Used to derive encryption key for identity storage
- Cleared from memory on lock/exit

**Private Key Storage:**
- Encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key derived via Argon2id from master password
- Unique salt per identity (16 bytes)
- Unique nonce per encryption (12 bytes)

**Argon2id Parameters:**
- Time cost: 3 iterations
- Memory cost: 65536 KB (64 MB)
- Parallelism: 1 thread
- Output: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- Type: Argon2id (hybrid mode)

**Why Argon2id?**
- Winner of Password Hashing Competition (2015)
- Resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks
- Memory-hard function
- Protection against side-channel attacks
- Recommended by OWASP and security experts
- Makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive (~1-2 seconds per attempt)

### Fingerprint Verification

**Algorithm:** SHA-256
- **Input:** X25519 public key (32 bytes)
- **Output:** 256-bit (64 hex character) fingerprint
- **Purpose:** Human-verifiable contact authentication

**Verification Process:**
1. Generate fingerprint from contact's public key
2. Display fingerprint to user
3. User verifies fingerprint out-of-band (phone call, in person, etc.)
4. Mark contact as verified only after confirmation
5. Future connections verify fingerprint automatically

**Protection Against:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- Impersonation attacks
- Key substitution attacks

---

## Network Security

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

**No Servers:**
- All communication is direct peer-to-peer
- TCP connections established directly between users
- No intermediary servers or relays
- No cloud storage or processing

**Benefits:**
- No single point of failure
- No server to compromise
- No data retention by third parties
- No surveillance infrastructure
- Complete control over your data

### Connection Security

**Handshake Process:**
1. TCP connection established
2. X25519 public keys exchanged
3. Fingerprint verification
4. Session keys derived
5. Encrypted communication begins

**Ongoing Security:**
- Keepalive pings every 30 seconds
- Automatic reconnection on disconnection
- Connection timeout after 90 seconds without pong
- Session keys unique per connection
- No key reuse across connections

### Protocol Security

**Message Format:**
- Fixed-size header (7 bytes)
- Protocol version (1 byte)
- Message type (2 bytes)
- Payload length (4 bytes)
- Encrypted payload (variable)

**Protections:**
- Version checking prevents protocol confusion
- Length limits prevent memory exhaustion
- Authentication tags prevent tampering
- Nonce uniqueness prevents replay attacks

## Threat Model

### Protected Against

✓ **Brute-Force Attacks**
- Argon2id makes password cracking extremely expensive
- 64 MB memory requirement per attempt
- ~1-2 seconds per attempt on modern hardware

✓ **Dictionary Attacks**
- Same Argon2id protection as brute-force
- Unique salt per identity prevents rainbow tables

✓ **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
- Fingerprint verification detects key substitution
- Out-of-band verification required

✓ **Eavesdropping**
- Five layers of encryption protect all traffic
- Even if one layer is broken, four others remain

✓ **Tampering**
- Authenticated encryption detects any modifications
- Invalid authentication tags cause message rejection

✓ **Server Compromise**
- No servers to compromise
- All data stays on user devices

✓ **Data Breaches**
- No cloud storage means nothing to breach
- Local data is encrypted at rest

✓ **Network Analysis**
- Only encrypted data transmitted
- No metadata leakage beyond endpoints

✓ **Replay Attacks**
- Unique nonces prevent message replay
- Session keys prevent cross-session replay

### NOT Protected Against

✗ **Weak Master Passwords**
- User responsibility to choose strong password
- Recommend: 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Consider using a passphrase for memorability

✗ **Keyloggers**
- Compromised system can capture password input
- Use trusted, malware-free systems only

✗ **Screen Capture**
- Compromised system can record displayed messages
- Use trusted systems for sensitive conversations

✗ **Physical Access**
- Unlocked computer grants full access
- Lock your computer when away
- Enable screen lock after idle timeout

✗ **Coercion**
- Users can be forced to reveal passwords
- Legal authorities may compel disclosure
- Consider deniability strategies if at risk

✗ **Memory Dumps**
- Running process memory may contain plaintext
- Use full-disk encryption for physical security
- Lock application when not in use

✗ **Social Engineering**
- Users can be tricked into revealing information
- Verify contact identity through multiple channels
- Be suspicious of unusual requests

## Best Practices for Users

### Master Password

**Creating:**
- Minimum 12 characters (recommend 16+)
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Avoid dictionary words
- Use a passphrase for memorability
- Example: "correct horse battery staple" + numbers/symbols

**Storing:**
- Write it down physically in a secure location
- Don't store in a text file
- Don't share via email or messaging
- Consider a physical backup in a safe

**Recovery:**
- There is NO password recovery mechanism
- If you forget it, your identity is lost forever
- This is by design for security
- Keep a physical backup of your password

### Fingerprint Verification

**When to Verify:**
- Always verify fingerprints for new contacts
- Verify through a trusted out-of-band channel
- Phone call, video call, or in person

**How to Verify:**
1. Contact shares their fingerprint
2. You verify it matches what Jarvis shows
3. Mark contact as verified only after confirmation
4. Both parties should verify each other

**Never:**
- Trust fingerprints sent over the same channel
- Skip verification for "trusted" contacts
- Verify electronically only (voice confirmation needed)

### Network Security

**Port Forwarding:**
- Use a high port number (10000-65000)
- Don't expose unnecessary services
- Consider using a VPN for additional privacy

**Firewall:**
- Allow only Jarvis on your chosen port
- Block all other incoming connections
- Use a router firewall in addition to OS firewall

**IP Address:**
- Consider using a VPN to hide your real IP
- Be aware that contacts see your IP address
- Use local IPs for local network testing

### System Security

**Operating System:**
- Keep your OS updated with security patches
- Use full-disk encryption
- Enable firewall
- Use antivirus/anti-malware software

**Physical Security:**
- Lock your computer when away
- Enable screen lock after idle timeout
- Use BIOS/UEFI password
- Consider encrypted swap/page file

**Network Security:**
- Use behind a router with firewall
- Consider VPN for additional privacy
- Be aware of network monitoring on public WiFi
- Use secure, trusted networks only

### Usage Habits

**Daily Operation:**
- Lock Jarvis when stepping away
- Close application when not in use
- Don't leave conversations visible on screen
- Clear terminal scrollback regularly

**Contact Management:**
- Only add trusted contacts
- Verify fingerprints before marking verified
- Remove contacts you no longer trust
- Regularly review contact list

**Message Security:**
- Don't share sensitive info until verified
- Be aware messages are stored locally
- Delete conversations you don't need
- Consider manual backups of important messages
